        <p>
          My professional journey began after graduating in 2022 from Coventry University with a First Class Honours BSc in Computer Science. I stepped into the fast-paced world of startups, joining an insurtech company where I worked primarily with the .NET tech stack. My role involved building complex backend web solutions and integrating third-party systems — an experience that sharpened my technical skills and exposed me to the importance of customer-focused development.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2023, I transitioned into a global shipping and logistics company, where I joined a small internal team working with low-code platforms. We developed web-based tools that automated internal processes, cut operational costs, and improved overall efficiency — a hands-on role that taught me how to solve big problems with smart, scalable internal tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          From there, I moved into the financial sector, working at a UK bank where I contributed to the development of a savings account mobile app. The work combined low-code applications with custom-built web backend services to create a seamless and secure customer experience. I also worked on back-office portals and tools for financial crime reporting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following this, I took on a short-term contract role with an AI startup as a Technical Sales Consultant, where I helped bridge the gap between highly technical offerings and client needs — refining my communication and solution-design skills in the process.

        <h2 class="about-subtitle">Skills & Technologies</h2>
        <p>
          Over the years, I've gained experience with a variety of technologies and approaches including .NET, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, REST APIs, low-code platforms (such as Mendix and Outsystems), Git, Agile workflows, and continuous integration tools. I’m also passionate about Linux, automation, and building efficient, accessible web applications that solve real-world problems.
